An objective function is a function that takes a complete solution and evaluates how "good" it is, while a heuristic function takes a partial solution and makes a guess as to how close it is to an optimal solution. 

Both functions involve calculating a value of the current state. The important difference is that the objective function has a complete solution to work with, while a heuristic has only a partial solution. This means that the objective function can "test" the solution directly and get a correct "value" of the state, while a heuristic has to use some clever guesswork based on knowledge of the properties of the current state and some assumption about the solution.
