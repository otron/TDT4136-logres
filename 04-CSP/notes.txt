	K,T
	Where K = you know what this is.
	and T = average time until an optimal solution was found (five optimal solutions were generated)
	I'm sorry it's not actually graphed.

There's probably some sort of maxSteps-to-K ratio that's optimal. I did not try very hard to look for it.
I did however manage to solve K = 11000 in less than 1min (averaged out of the time it took to find five solutions).
